# Anagram Finder

### Requirements

Implement functionality that reads a dictionary file and allows a user to find anagrams. You should allow for the upload of a text file which will be the dictionary file. The dictionary file consists of a list of words. Each word is on separate line. A sample file is provided: `dictionary.txt`

The app should provide an input where a user can input a word of their choice. On hitting enter (or clicking a button) the app should find all anagrams, if any exist, of the word and display them. If no anagrams are found it should display “No anagrams found for ___”.Please also display timings for loading the dictionary and timings for each anagram set request.The user must be able to continually enter new words which the app will search for anagrams on until the browser window is closed. The app should retain the display of previous results and not clear them after each search.### Deliverables

1. Provide your solution in the form of a zip file.
2. The app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000
3. Please explain any design decisions you make in `MY-NOTES.md`
4. Please state how you would improve this app with a production environment in mind. For example, how would you handle a dictionary file of 1,000,000 words?
5. Please provide an estimation of the time it took to complete this task.### Rules
1. You may not edit the Gemfile. Only the specified Ruby version and gems can be used.2. You may not use external, third party libraries to do with the loading of the dictionary or anagram solving part of this test.### Additional notes
1. The app is already a git repository. Use accordingly.2. Tests are strongly recommended. If you do not write tests you should be able to justify your reasons for doing so.
